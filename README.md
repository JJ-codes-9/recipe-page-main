## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned and will practice
Practiced the use of pseudo-element selectors and more CSS. 
Couldn't figure out the borders in the table section but we'll work on it. 
Have to figure out why I couldn't use the fonts that are already in the folder and needed to add the @import in CSS.
